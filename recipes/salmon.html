    <img src="./images/salmon.jpg" alt="Salmon cooked" >
    <p>Use fresh pomegranate as well as molasses to get a deeper flavour in this salmon recipe. Serve with couscous or steamed green veg, if you like</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>4 salmon fillets</li>
        <li>2 tbsp pomegranate molasses</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>½ lime, juiced</li>
        <li>1 pomegranate, seeds only</li>
        <li>½ small bunch of parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 mint leaves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 small red onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>couscous and steamed green veg, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the salmon skin-side down on a large baking sheet. Mix the pomegranate molasses, ½ tbsp olive oil and half the lime juice with a good pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper in a small bowl, then brush the mixture all over the flesh of the salmon. Chill for at least 20 mins, or overnight if you can.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Mix the pomegranate seeds with the parsley, mint, red onion, remaining lime juice and olive oil in a bowl, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Roast the salmon, uncovered, for 10-12 mins, until cooked through. You can check this by poking a knife into the fillet and ensuring the fish flakes easily. Top the salmon with the salsa, and serve with couscous or steamed green veg, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
